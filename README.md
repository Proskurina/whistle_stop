@proskurina, @Benaud12 and my Chrome extension to close the current window when you whistle loudly and then wait for a moment.

The code still needs lots of tidying up. Make sure you refresh the page you’re currently on after enabling the extension (or open a new one).

Also, bear in mind you’ll lose your other tabs in the active window! :-)
